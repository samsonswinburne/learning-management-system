# learning-management-system
made using asp.net and next.js
I'm still new to both frameworks (particularly next.js) so this is intended to be a learning project.
This my my first medium scale project so expect there to be some interesting choices made relating to the whole structure of the project.
I definitely deserve a summer internship.
